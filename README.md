Clock &amp; weather on Raspberry Pi &amp; 7" touchscreen

This code was written for a clock and weather display project detailed in a series of posts starting here:
https://www.techissocool.com/diy-clock-weather-plus-part-1/

It's vanilla html/css/js and would be easy to adapt. The weather info comes from a NodeJs server on the Pi, the code for which will be posted soon.
